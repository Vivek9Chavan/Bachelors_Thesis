The current study deals with the development of a mathematical model for the design and simulation of a thermal oil heater. A Thermal Oil Heater is a fired heater to produce hot thermal oil by firing desired fuel. A generalized approach is incorporated in the modeling for steady state Thermal Oil Heater design and simulation. Generalized model is developed for a typical double helical coil industrial Thermal Oil Heater. Heat transfer between flue gas and thermal oil is quite complex in this type of heat exchanger. A generalized heat exchanger network is developed to represent the heat interactions between thermal oil and flue gas. This network is used for the development of a mathematical model and an iterative technique for the solution of mathematical model is employed. The mathematical model is used for the simulation of experimental thermal oil heater and validated with the experimental result. The mathematical model is further employed to study the effect of various design and operating parameters on the performance of thermal oil heater. This study can be used for the design and optimization of thermal oil heater.
